# TODO List app

## Setup

Run `npm install`.

## Start the application

Run `npm run firebase:start` in one terminal to start the Firebase storage and authentication emulators.

Note: this will automatically download the emulators if they are not found.

Run `npm start` in another terminal to start the application.

The application at http://localhost:3000 should automatically open on your browser. To prevent this, add BROWSER=none in your .env file.

If needed, access the Firebase Emulator UI at http://localhost:4000.
